Problem 1
---------

Read in and clean nyc transit data

``` r
transit_df = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/nyc_transit_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"), 
        entry, vending, starts_with("entrance"), ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

The data set *transit df* contains information on entrance specifications as well as available routes and ADA compliancy for each subway station in New York City. The variables included are: line, station\_name, station\_latitude, station\_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending, entrance\_type, entrance\_latitude, entrance\_longitude, entrance\_location, ada. These variables were specifically selected from the parent NYC\_Transit\_Subway\_Entrance\_And\_Exit\_Data dataset. The janitor function was used to clean the variable names and the entry variable was converted from character type to logical. The dimensions of *transit df* are 22 columns by 1868 rows. These data are not tidy because the route1-route11 columns should be collapsed into one column.

``` r
stations_df = distinct(transit_df, station_name, line, .keep_all = TRUE)
  distinct_stations = nrow(stations_df)
  ada_compliant = nrow(filter(stations_df, ada == TRUE))
  
  without_vending = nrow(filter(stations_df, vending == "NO"))
  entrance_without_vending = nrow(filter(stations_df, vending == "NO", entry == TRUE))
  prop_entrance = round((entrance_without_vending / without_vending), digits = 3)
```

There are 465 distinct stations in the data set. 84 stations are ADA compliant. The proportion of non-vending stations that allow entry is 0.556.

Problem 3
---------

install p8105 data package

``` r
devtools::install_github("p8105/p8105.datasets")
```

    ## Skipping install of 'p8105.datasets' from a github remote, the SHA1 (21f5ad1c) has not changed since last install.
    ##   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation
